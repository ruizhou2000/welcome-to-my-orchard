Garden designer and fruit expert Colby Eierman’s Fruit Trees In Small Spaces (Timber
Press, 2012) shows how trees can easily be tucked into the tiniest spots and still yield a
bumper crop of gorgeous fruit. Learn everything a gardener needs to know about choosing and nurturing the most delicious varieties in this excerpt taken from part one, “Designing Your Small Orchard.”<br />
Luscious peaches, crisp apples, and sweet plums right off the tree are hard to beat.
For gardeners yearning for the pleasures of home-grown fruit plucked straight from the
tree, this deliciously encouraging guide cuts the subject down to size. Colby Eierman, garden designer and fruit expert, shows how trees can easily be tucked into the tiniest spots
and still yield a bumper crop of gorgeous fruit.<br />
Fruit Trees in Small Spaces covers everything a gardener needs to know about choosing
and nurturing the most delicious small-space varieties, including selection, pruning, training,
irrigation, and disease prevention. With inspiring ideas for spaces of all shapes and sizes
and creative recipes for your incredible harvest, you’ll want to plant a mini-orchard in every
intimate corner.<br /> 
For the gardener with space limitations, bountiful fruit trees are now within arm’s reach.</span></p>

						You might find it a stretch to call your little slice of fruit-growing heaven a full-blown orchard, but what the heck, it’s your place and you can do what you want. Personally, I like the
images that the word orchard conjures up. I like thinking about the orchards that used to
(and in some cases still do) dominate the landscapes where we live. I like old wooden fruit
boxes and the smell of fermenting cider. I try to seek out the old-timers in my community
to tap into their hard-earned knowledge of how to keep critters at bay or to glean an old
family recipe for applesauce.<br />
I also want to be part of a different type of agricultural community that is striving to weave
some of that not-so-distant past into our modern lives. Some of us are actually going to
produce a large amount of what we consume from our own urban or suburban plots. Many
of us will only dabble in growing and still find a valuable connection to our sustenance and
perhaps our community. That is probably the main appeal for me in writing this book—to
enhance someone’s connection to his or her village through food production.<br />
One of my favorite things about a garden is that it is never finished. It is always changing,
growing and (not to get too morbid here at the start) at the same time dying. Some plants
can thrive for a few years and then outgrow their space or simply stop prospering. Remind
yourself of this fact as you begin designing your space and selecting trees. Plants aren’t
the Great Pyramids of Giza, after all. A garden is a living, breathing entity, and with simple
tools, we can change the things that aren’t working for us. We can provide all the food, water, and shelter a tree could want and it still might die on us. If and when that happens, remember that plenty of worthy candidates are in line right behind it, waiting to fill that space.
This chapter starts with a broad overview of the climatic factors that affect which trees will
grow where you live. From here, we move to the finer details of your specific site and explore ways to take advantage of the complexities inherent is most garden plots. You could
design your yard and your fruit trees in an infinite number of ways, but you have to choose
only one design. A few of my favorite design elements are covered here, followed by three
sample designs.
